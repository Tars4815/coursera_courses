# Course 2 - R Programming

## Week 1 - Background, Getting Started, and Nuts & Bolts
Introduction to data types and objects. Tabular data readings.

## Week 2 - Programming with R
The lectures cover key topics like control structures and functions.

## Week 3 - Loop Functions and Debugging
The lectures this week cover loop functions and the debugging tools in R. These aspects of R make R useful for both interactive work and writing longer code, and so they are commonly used in practice.

## Week 4 - Simulation & Profiling
This week covers how to simulate data in R, which serves as the basis for doing simulation studies. It also covers the profiler in R which lets you collect detailed information on how your R functions are running and to identify bottlenecks that can be addressed. The profiler is a key tool in helping you optimize your programs.
